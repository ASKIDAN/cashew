In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

# Implemented design is close to FSD (Feature Sliced Design) 
Bit similar to Atomic Design.
Look on folders like in next direction: shared -> entities -> features -> pages -> app

# another point: API
1. has not secure endpoints, so I cant demonstrate correctly how application should protect private pages 
2. doesnt provide identificators which can be usefful for fetching current user
